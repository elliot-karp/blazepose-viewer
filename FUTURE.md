# Backlog / Future ideas

## 3D Pose Viewer (compare)

Use BlazePose's 3D (world) landmarks for two poses and render them in a 3D scene (e.g. Three.js or React Three Fiber):

- Two stick figures or point clouds side by side (or overlaid) to see how the poses differ in 3D.
- Rotate, zoom, pan the 3D view.
- Highlight joints with the largest angle differences.
- Could also animate between the two poses to show the transition.

## Other ideas

- **Video mode**: Run BlazePose on a video file frame-by-frame and show angle changes over time (graph).
- **Session recording**: Record a camera session and replay with overlay.
- **Export data**: Export angle data as CSV for external analysis.
- **More joints / custom angles**: Let users define their own angle triplets from the 33 landmarks.
- **PWA / offline**: Make the app installable and fully offline-capable.
